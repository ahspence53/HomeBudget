Overview.
This app is designed to help you manage your home budget, on the assumption that all income (salary, pension etc) and expense (all outgoings) are transactions within one bank,account.

The app allows for income and expense on monthly and 4-weekly intervals
You can also add irregular income and expense items (one off items that will always come up)

The top part of the screen has opening balance (the balance of your account when you begin using the app) and the start date (the start date when you begin using the app)
Next are listed all your income and expense transactions, this is where you define whether they are monthly or 4-weekly, you should also enter the type of category (Household, Savings, Insurance, Car etc).

The bottom table is 24-month projection. When you add a transaction, the system uses the start date and opening balance and immediately populates the 24-month projection table with the transactions for 24 months from the currently defined start date. 
Going forward, you can leave the start date as it is when you initially set the system up, but more likely you will amend the start date and opening balance, perhaps on a weekly basis, because once you are satisfied the transaction has come off your bank account, you have a record of that in that bank account. This app is about managing your finances going forward, and the 24-month projection table will show quite clearly what your finances will,be at any point in the next 24 months.
