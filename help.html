<A NAME="Overview"></A><B>Overview</B>.
This app is designed to help you manage your home budget, on the assumption that all income (salary, pension etc) and expense (all outgoings) are transactions within one bank,account.

The app allows for <B>income</B> and <B>expense </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">on</SPAN> <B>monthly and 4-weekly intervals</B>
You can also add <B>irregular</B> income and expense items (one off items that will always come up)

The top part of the screen has <B>opening</B> <B>balance</B> (the balance of your account when you begin using the app) and the <B>start</B> <B>date</B> (the start date when you begin using the app)
Next are listed all your <B>income</B> and <B>expense</B> transactions, this is where you define whether they are <B>monthly</B> or <B>4-weekly, </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">you should also enter the type of category (Household, Savings, Insurance, Car etc).</SPAN>

The bottom table is <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>24-month projection</B></SPAN>. When you add a transaction, the system uses the <B>start</B> <B>date</B> and <B>opening</B> <B>balance</B> and immediately populates the 24-month projection table with the transactions for 24 months from the currently defined <B>start</B> <B>date.</B> 
Going forward, you can leave the <B>start</B> <B>date</B> as it is when you initially set the system up, but more likely you will amend the <B>start</B> <B>date</B> and <B>opening</B> <B>balance</B>, perhaps on a weekly basis, because once you are satisfied the transaction has come off your bank account, you have a record of that in that bank account. This app is about managing your finances <I>going</I> <I>forward</I>, and the <B>2</B><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>4-month projection</B></SPAN> table will show quite clearly what your finances will,be at any point in the next 24 months.

<A NAME="Manually"></A>How to set up manually.
To start the app, enter a star date and your bank balance (opening balance) on this date.
The 24-month projection table is then populated with one line per day from the start date for 24 months.
Next, you should add whatever expense categories you want eg. Household, Insurance, Savings.
Then start adding your expense (direct debits) and income (salary) transactions. If your start date is on 12th January, enter transactions from that date, till 11th February - this gives you one month's transactions. 
You add a Description, Amount, Type (Income or Expense), Period (Monthly or Weekly - you can also add irregular), Date and Category.
As you add each transaction, the 24-month projection table will automatically be populated with one transaction per month for 24 months. Similarly, if you add a 4-weekly transaction, it will add it every 4 weeks from your initial date.
You should add one month's of transactions, thereafter the 24-month projection table will show you projected bank balances for each day from the start date for 2 years.
