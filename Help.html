<A NAME="Overview"></A><B>Overview</B>.
This app is designed to help you manage your home budget, on the assumption that all income (salary, pension etc) and expense (all outgoings) are transactions within one bank,account.

The app allows for <B>income</B> and <B>expense </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">on</SPAN><B> monthly and 4-weekly intervals</B>
You can also add <B>irregular</B> income and expense items (one off items that will always come up)

The top part of the screen has <B>opening</B> <B>balance</B> (the balance of your account when you begin using the app) and the <B>start</B> <B>date</B> (the start date when you begin using the app)
Next are listed all your <B>income</B> and <B>expense</B> transactions, this is where you define whether they are <B>monthly</B> or <B>4-weekly, </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">you should also enter the type of category (Household, Savings, Insurance, Car etc).</SPAN>

The bottom table is <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>24-month projection</B></SPAN>. When you add a transaction, the system uses the <B>start</B> <B>date</B> and <B>opening</B> <B>balance</B> and immediately populates the 24-month projection table with the transactions for 24 months from the currently defined <B>start</B> <B>date.</B> 
Going forward, you can leave the <B>start</B> <B>date</B> as it is when you initially set the system up, but more likely you will amend the <B>start</B> <B>date</B> and <B>opening</B> <B>balance</B>, perhaps on a weekly basis, because once you are satisfied the transaction has come off your bank account, you have a record of that in that bank account. This app is about managing your finances <I>going</I> <I>forward</I>, and the <B>2</B><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>4-month projection</B></SPAN> table will show quite clearly what your finances will,be at any point in the next 24 months.</PRE>
