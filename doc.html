<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<pre class="oview">
This app is designed to help you manage your home budget, on the assumption that all 
income (salary, pension etc) and expense (all outgoings) are transactions within one bank account.

The app allows for income and expense on monthly and 4-weekly intervals.
You can also add irregular income and expense items (one off items that will always come up).

The top part of the screen has opening balance (the balance of your account when you begin using the app) 
and the start date (the start date when you begin using the app)

Next are listed all your income and expense transactions, this is where you define whether they are monthly 
or 4-weekly, you should also enter the type of category (Household, Savings, Insurance, Car etc).

The bottom table is 24-month projection. When you add a transaction, the system uses the start date and 
opening balance and immediately populates the 24-month projection table with the transactions for 24 months 
from the currently defined start date.
Going forward, you can leave the start date as it is when you initially set the system up, 
but more likely you will amend the start date and opening balance, perhaps on a weekly basis, 
because once you are satisfied the transaction has come off your bank account, you have a record of that 
in that bank account. 

This app is about managing your finances going forward, and the 24-month projection table will show quite 
clearly what your finances will,be at any point in the next 24 months.

<h2 id="setup">How to set up manually</h2>
<pre class="oview">
First, enter a start date by clicking into <b>Start date</b> field and selecting a date from the date picker.
Next, enter the <b>Opening Balance</b> of your bank account on that date, then click <b>Save.</b>

You should now add your <b>Categories</b>. eg. Household, Insurance, Savings etc. Enter your first Category in 
the box below Start Date, then click <b>Add Category</b>. Add as many Categories as you need, 
you can add more as required. 
Now start adding your transactions by adding a calendar month's to ensure you 
have all your data entered.

In the box below Select Category, type in the <b>Description</b>, next the <b>Amount</b>, then select whether the 
transaction is <b>Expense</b> or <b>Income</b>. 

The next field allows to select the transaction <i>Period</i>
normally either <b>Monthly</b> or, if it's relevant <b>4-Weekly</b>. 
You can select <b>Irregular</b> for one off transactions. 

The next field allows you to select the <b>Date</b> for the transaction - either the date for 
<b>Monthly</b> transactions, or the <i>first</i> date <b>after</b> the <b>Start date</b> of a <b>4-weekly transaction</b>
Next select the appropriate <b>Category</b> for the transaction. 

Finally, click <b>Add Transaction</b>.
The transaction will appear in the table below. 
Add as many transactions as you require.

As you add transactions, they will appear in the <b>24 Month Transaction</b>table.

<b>Note!</b>
<i>On first use, you should enter, starting from your <b> Start date</b> all of your <b>Monthly</b> transactions 
for one calendar month. If you have <b>4-Weekly transactions</b> add the next date after the start date they 
are due and ensure you enter all of this type.

The system will calculate the transactions and populate the <b>24 Month Projection</b> table.

If you do have <b>4-Weekly</b> transactions, once the date you enter initially has passed, the system will 
alter the day of the month shown in the <b>transaction</b> table by adding 28 days to ensure 
these <i>days</i> are always accurate</i>

<h2 id="csv">How to import transactions via CSV</h2>
<pre class="oview">
Building the system (app) using <b>Import transactions (csv)</b> is the quickest method of creating
transactions so that the <b>24 Month Projection</b> can be populated.
It relies on you creating a spreadsheet containing a row for each transaction. The spreadsheet
should then be saved as a <b>CSV</b> file to a location on your Computer or Tablet that is readily
accessible for any subsequent re-loads.
The format of the spreadsheet is strict and <b>must</b> adhere to the following specification;

The data should be in the format;
Column A:Header text=<b>Date</b>, content - standard date format
Column B:Header text=<b>Amount</b>, content - numeric
Column C:Header text=<b>Income/Expense</b>, content - either the text <b>income</b> or <b>expense</b>
Column D:Header text=<b>Category </b>, content - Text containing your chosen category
Column E:Header text=<b>Description </b>, content - Text containing a description of the transaction.
Column F:Header text=<b>Frequency </b>, content - either the text <b>Monthly</b> or <b>4-Weekly</b>
<b>Note!</b> 
The header row is case sensitive and <b>must</b> be as shown.
The Income/Expense data is also case sensitive, lower case.
The frequency is case sensitive and <b>must</b> be as shown.

On the first build of the system, enter start date and opening balance, the click on 
<b>choose file</b> next to <b>Import transactions CSV </b> then click <b>Import (replace existing)</b>
The transactions will instantly load. If there are any errors and alert will inform you.
Simply scroll to see all your transactions.
<b>An example of loading data</b>
If you have a start date of 12th Jan 2026 with an opening balance of <b>£x.yz</b>
your spreadsheet should have, as it's initial transaction, one dated 12th Jan 2026 (if you have one then)
<b>OR</b>one for the <b>NEXT</b>date after that. Then add your transactions in date order from then till
<b>11th Feb 2026</b>. This gives you one month's worth of transactions to load into the app.
